Problem 
1.2 Write a function filter_long_words() that takes a list of words and an integer n and returns
the list of words that are longer than n.

def filter_long_words(words,int_value):
    out_list=[]
    for n in words:
        if len(n)>int_value:
            out_list.append(n)
    return out_list

print(filter_long_words(["January","Feburary","March","April","May","June","July"],4))

Problem 2.1 Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers
representing the lengths of the corresponding words .
Hint: If a list [ ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as [2,3,4]
Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list.

def map_list_int(words):
    out_list=[]
    for n in words:
            out_list.append(len(n))
    return out_list

print(map_list_int(["January","Feburary","March","April","May","June","July"]))

2.2 Write a Python function which takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if
it is a vowel, False otherwise.

def check_vowel(character):
    vowel_parm =['a','e','i','o','u']
    temp= False
    for n in vowel_parm:
        if character.lower() == n:
            temp = True
    return temp

print(check_vowel('e'))
